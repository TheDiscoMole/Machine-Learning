<center> A short description of my Machine Learning skillset. </center>

-----------------------------------------------------------

Approximately 7-8 years ago I discovered Theano and Machine Learning, and specifically Deep Learning has been one of my interests ever since. 

My skillset is primarily self-taught through YouTube, Wikipedia, Blogs, etc. In early years I focussed on an intuitive understanding of neuro-computational structures through and YouTube playlists like [Neural Networks Demystified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxe2T-V8XRs&list=PLiaHhY2iBX9hdHaRr6b7XevZtgZRa1PoU), online courses like the, now removed/revised self-driving car course on Udacity by Sebastian Thrun and open source learning libs/tools like [OpenAI Gym](http://gym.openai.com/). Later I delved into writing CUDA level Python extensions, for my own personal Neural Network optimization & model research, and playing around with the source code of existing ML projects, like Magenta's [GANSynth Waveform Synthesizer](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/gansynth) and NVidia's pyTorch [Tacotron2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2) implementation.

The majorty of this self-forged path is guided by my interest in General Purpose Intelligence and a long standing pet project which intends to implement Neurogenesis, Synaptogenesis and several other smaller tweeks into the core functionality of the Gradient Decent algorithm.

## EDUCATION

Over the years my intellectual interests have shifted here and there. From Mathematics to Psychology, Physics to Philosophy, Quantum Mechanics to Neuroscience and ever so slowly converging on Artificial Intelligence. Though my personal life was a little messy over the years and I dropped out of University twice, it was never due to an inability to keep up with the course.
