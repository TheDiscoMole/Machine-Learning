<center> A short description of my Machine Learning skillset. </center>

-----------------------------------------------------------

Approximately 7-8 years I discovered Theano and Machine Learning, and specifically theoretical Deep Learning has been one of my interests ever since. My skillset is self-taught through projects, YouTube, Wiki artictles and, in early years, have found especially [Split Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain) patients, the basics of [Group Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory) and [Neural Networks Demystified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxe2T-V8XRs&list=PLiaHhY2iBX9hdHaRr6b7XevZtgZRa1PoU) useful to try and understand neuro-computational structures more intuitively whilst also gaining a rigorous understanding of the mathematical principles behind Deep Learning like Linear Algebra, Gradient Descent & Derivatives, etc and getting to grips with useful programming languages and tools to implement actual solutions. The learning process in more recent years has mainly consisted of reading blog-posts of various prejects from [Deepmind](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/gansynth) and [OpenAI](http://gym.openai.com/) and delving into the source code for those projects and pyTorch itself. All of this has been predominantly guided by my main [AI project]({{site.url}}/real-intelligence/).

## EDUCATION

Over the years my intellectual interests have shifted here and there. From Mathematics to Psychology, Physics to Philosophy, Quantum Mechanics to Neuroscience and ever so slowly converging on Artificial Intelligence. Though my personal life was a little messy over the years and I dropped out of University twice, it was never due to an inability to keep up with the course.
