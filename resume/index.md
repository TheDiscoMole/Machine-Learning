<center> This contains the summized history of my modest Machine Learning skillset. </center>

-----------------------------------------------------------

Over the years my intellectual interests have shifted here and there. From Mathematics to Psychology, Physics to Philosophy, Quatum Mechanics to Neuroscience and ever so slowly converging on Artificial Intelligence. Though my personal life was messy and I dropped out of University twice it was never really due to an inability to keep up with the course. It has been more the result of inner discourse and a boredom with the slow and often disappointing, supposed, intellectual stimulation university is known for. Fortunately i was born in the age of the internet and computers. If there is something you wish to learn about there will be dozens of videos on YouTube showing you how, especially if it involves programming. The last year or so I have been delving into Psychological/Neurological phenomena such as Split Brain patients and the Somasensory Homonculus to try and understand neuro-computational structures more intuitively whilst also gaining a rigorous understanding of the mathematical principles behind Deep Learning involving Linear Algebra, Gradient Descent & Derivatives, etc and getting to firm grips with useful programming languages and tools to implement actual solutions. The entire learning process has been part of my [main interest and project in AI](/real-intelligence/).
