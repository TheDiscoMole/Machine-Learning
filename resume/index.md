<center> This contains the summized history of my modest Machine Learning skillset. </center>

-----------------------------------------------------------

## SKILLS

The last year or so I have been delving into Psychological & Neurological phenomena such as [Split Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain) patients and the [Motor & Sensory Homunculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_homunculus) to try and understand neuro-computational structures more intuitively whilst also gaining a rigorous understanding of the mathematical principles behind Deep Learning like Linear Algebra, Gradient Descent & Derivatives, etc and getting to firm grips with useful programming languages and tools to implement actual solutions. The entire learning process has been part of my [main interest and project in AI]({{site-url}}/real-intelligence/). *Below you will find a rough ranking of my Deep Learning related skillset:*

## EDUCATION

Over the years my intellectual interests have shifted here and there. From Mathematics to Psychology, Physics to Philosophy, Quantum Mechanics to Neuroscience and ever so slowly converging on Artificial Intelligence. Though my personal life was messy and I dropped out of University twice, it wasn't really due to an inability to keep up with the course, but rather the result of inner discourse and dissatisfaction with the education I recieved. *Here is a summary of what my official education has entailed so far:*

-----------------------------------------------------------

2010: [graduated](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9uCsNmRtZ2CTlZQOWNDdVZwSXM) from the **[English International College](http://eicmarbella.org/)** with **[A-Levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCE_Advanced_Level)** in:

* Mathematics
* Further Mathematics
* Physics
* Economics
* German

2012: withdrew from **[Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/)** studying **[MEng Mathematics and Computer Science](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/current-students/jmc-info/jmc-first-year/)**, some courses entailed:

* Linear Algebra
* Methods
* Analysis
* Logic
* Programming
* ...

2015: withdrew from **[King's College London](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/index.aspx)** studying **[BEng Computer Science with Intelligent Systems](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/computer-science-with-intelligent-systems-bsc.aspx)**, some courses entailed:

* Artificial Intelligence
* Robotics
* Control Systems
* Agents and Multi-Agent Systems
* Computer Vision
* Pattern Recognition
* Signals and Systems
* ...

-----------------------------------------------------------

## EXPERIENCE

Even though I haven't had much professional experience there are some things worth mentioning in relation to a potential software/machine learning placement.

-----------------------------------------------------------

2011-2012: worked at **[Localsoft Games](http://www.localsoft.com/)** as a **Video Game Tester**, this job entailed:

* Localisation Testing
* QA Software Testing

summer 2014: [worked](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9uCsNmRtZ2CSGJYRWtWZ2dxQ00) at **[Onalytica](http://www.onalytica.com/)** as a **[Data Scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) Intern**, this job entailed:

* Real-Time Datastreams
