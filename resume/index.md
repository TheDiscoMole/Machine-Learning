<center> A short description of my Machine Learning skillset. </center>

-----------------------------------------------------------

Approximately 7-8 years ago I discovered Theano and Machine Learning, and specifically Deep Learning has been one of my interests ever since.

My skill-set is primarily self-taught through YouTube, Wikipedia, Blogs, etc. In early years I focused on an intuitive understanding of neuro-computational structures through and YouTube playlists like [Neural Networks Demystified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxe2T-V8XRs&list=PLiaHhY2iBX9hdHaRr6b7XevZtgZRa1PoU), online courses like the, now removed/revised self-driving car course on Udacity by Sebastian Thrun and open source learning libs/tools like [OpenAI Gym](http://gym.openai.com/). Later I delved into writing CUDA level Python extensions, for my own personal Neural Network optimization & model research, and playing around with the source code of existing ML projects, like Magenta's [GANSynth Waveform Synthesizer](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/gansynth) and Nvidia's [Tacotron2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2) implementation.

The majority of this self-forged path is guided by my interest in General Purpose Intelligence and a long standing pet project which intends to implement Neurogenesis, Synaptogenesis and several other smaller tweaks into the core functionality of the Gradient Decent algorithm.
