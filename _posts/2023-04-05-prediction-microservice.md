Part 2 can be found **[HERE](https://thediscomole.github.io/portfolio/data-preprocessing-microservice/)**

This post describes the implementation basics required to write a cost-effective, high-uptime data pre-processing microservice on the Google Cloud as part of a Machine Learning pipeline. The example will implement a generic interface for the prediction of weather.
