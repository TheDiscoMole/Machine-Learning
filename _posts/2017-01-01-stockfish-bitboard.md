To test the performance of my Neurogensis & Synaptogenesis work I, much like every other AI nerd wanted to see how well it would perform

**NOTE** 

* use a Linux distro as your OS (like Arch-Linux) cause it makes the use deep learning tools, libraries and drivers so much easier
* unless you are planning to overclock (which is pointless for deep learning, you dont need anything other than factory coolers)
* a better CPU and Motherboard might make sense if you are able to spare the coin and plan to upgrade over time with dual GPU.
* thanks to the low power consumption craze, power supplies can be bought at even lower Watt-age and price.
