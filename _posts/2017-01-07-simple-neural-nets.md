Most Simple Neural Network implementations on github (or wherever else) suffer either from convoluted explanations or a rigid layered configurations. Has the brain, the inspiration for Neural Nets, proven to be so precisely layered? No, networks are complex in structure and that is something a NN implementation should embrace. We will be looking at a very simple Python implementation of a complexly layered graph. If you just care about the code, here are the links:
